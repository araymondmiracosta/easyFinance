This document shall provide a technical overview of the application. For function descriptions see KDoc formatted comments above each function.

Class overview:
	Initialized classes:
		Transaction: Holds the amount, date, time, category, description and name of account which it belongs to.
		MainActivity: Holds the onCreate function to initialize the application and the applicationNavHost to create different screens.

	Object classes:
		Utility: Holds non-composable helper functions which are used by other functions.
		Values: Holds global variables used by other functions.
		Views: Holds functions which draw main UI elements of the application.
		Viewlets: Holds composable helper functions which are used to draw minor UI elements of the interface.

Design notes:
	- The application uses an ArrayList holding transaction objects to store information (written to disk).
	- All screens and their root functions can be found in applicationNavHost() located in MainActivity.kt.
	- Themeing is currently based off of Material 3 Dynamic Colors, although any static themeing options in the future will be found in ui/theme/Theme.kt and ui/theme/Color.kt.
	- Transaction objects hold ZonedDateTime objects within them (always in UTC) for sorting functions.
